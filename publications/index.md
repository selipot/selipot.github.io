**16.** **Elipot, S.** et al. (2016), *Observed basin-scale response of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to wind stress forcing*, in revision for J. Clim., Nov. 2016

- In this paper, the response of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to wind stress forcing is investigated from an observational standpoint, using four time series of overturning transports below and relative to 1000 m, overlapping by 3.6 years. These time series are derived from four mooring arrays located on the western boundary of the North Atlantic. We find that , on the timescales available for this study, the basin-scale variability of wind stress significantly drives the MOC, as determined from mode decompositions of the analytic cross-covariance applied to the four transport time series and wind stress.

- In this paper we show that, despite expectations, the Agulhas Current has not intensified since the early 1990s. Instead, we find that it has broadened as a result of more eddy activity.

- In this paper, we investigate upwelling events inshore of the Agulhas Current at 34S. These events exchange shelf and slope waters, potentially enhancing primary productivity along the shelf and advecting larvae offshore. Hydrographic observations of a wind-driven upwelling event nd a current-driven upwelling event show that they can advect central waters more than 130 m upward onto the continental shelf, resulting in a 9C cooling. We use satellite data to assess the frequency, strength and forcing mechanisms of cold events from January 2003
11 through December 2011.

- This paper describes how we created a new [hourly surface drifter dataset](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/hourly_data.php), now available publicly through the [Data Assembly Center](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/dacdata.php) of the Global Drifter Program hosted at the [Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov)

- In this study we investigate in detail the variance of the Agulhas Current velocity field from the [ACT](http://act.rsmas.miami.edu) array, especially focussing on what is happening during meanders, the so-called Natal Pulses. For this we lay out the details of a method of analysis of rotary variance, dubbed Rotary EOF (REOF). We also combined in-situ data from the ACT array with altimetry data to research the origins, and fate, of meanders.

- This paper presents the first results from the velocity moorings deployed as part of the Agulhas Current Time-Series Experiment, or [ACT](http://act.rsmas.miami.edu), that took place between 2010 and 2013 in the Indian Ocean. We provide the longest in-situ record to date of the Agulhas Current Jet transport.

- Ekman’s theory of the wind-driven ocean surface boundary layer assumes a constant eddy viscosity and predicts that the current rotates with depth at the same rate as it decays in amplitude. This study presents a method for estimating ageostrophic currents from shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler data in Drake Passage and finds that observations are consistent with Ekman’s theory.

- This study investigates the coherence between ocean bottom pressure signals at the Rapid Climate Change programme (RAPID) West Atlantic Variability Experiment (WAVE) array on the western North Atlantic continental slope, including the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Line W. We find several types of coherent signals: barotropic kelvin-like waves that propagates at speeds in excess of \\( 128\, m s^{-1} \\), and pressure-difference signals propagating at about \\( 1\, m s^{-1} \\), roughly consistent iwth coastally-trapped waves. These last signals are expected to be associated with depth-dependent basinwide meridional transport variations or an overturning circulation.
