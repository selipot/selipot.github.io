- This is an open-access [OceanObs19](http://www.oceanobs19.net) community white paper. What is the Atlantic MOC and how is it observed? In this paper led by [Eleanor Frajka-Williams](https://www.noc.ac.uk/people/eefw1u08), we outline the different approaches used to observe the AMOC and summarize the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure, and hydrography from autonomous profiling floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches, state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches, we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC.

- This is an open-access [OceanObs19](http://www.oceanobs19.net) community white paper. Did you know that the majority of internet traffic takes place on a multitude of undersea communication cables that crisscross the ocean seafloor? In this paper led by [Bruce M. Howe](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/ore/people/faculty/bruce-m-howe/) we describe the mission of the SMART subsea cables initiative ([Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/climatechange/task-force-sc/Pages/default.aspx)). SMART sensors would “piggyback” on the power and communications infrastructure of a million kilometers of undersea fiber optic cable and thousands of repeaters, creating the potential for seafloor-based global ocean observing at a modest incremental cost.

- This paper studies the atmosphere-driven interannual variability of the Agulhas jet transport based on the altimeter proxy derived in [Beal and Elipot (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19853). We find that 29% of the interannual variance of the Agulhas Current transport can be linearly related to six modes of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric variability, including ENSO and a SAM-related mode. The Agulhas transport proxy time series can be downloaded via the [ACT website](http://http://act.rsmas.miami.edu) [here](http://http://act.rsmas.miami.edu/media/publications/).

- This paper explores the spatiotemporal covariance and forcing mechanisms of observed variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We developed a novel statistical method (analytic SVD) to investigate the relation between overturning transports from four arrays in the North Atlantic (RAPID WAVE, LINE W, RAPID MOC/MOCHA and MOVE) and patterns of wind stress and its curl over the basin. We identify two significant modes of variability in the overturning circulation driven by surface winds. The first mode manifests on seasonal time scales and is interpreted in terms of Ekman transports and barotropic return flows. The second mode is evident on nonseasonal time scales and is interpreted in terms of horizontal gyre circulation anomalies, which couple to the variable bottom topography to yield overturning circulation changes.

- In this paper we show that, despite expectations, the Agulhas Current has not intensified since the early 1990s. Instead, we find that it has broadened as a result of more eddy activity.

- In this paper, we investigate upwelling events inshore of the Agulhas Current at 34S. These events exchange shelf and slope waters, potentially enhancing primary productivity along the shelf and advecting larvae offshore. Hydrographic observations of a wind-driven upwelling event nd a current-driven upwelling event show that they can advect central waters more than 130 m upward onto the continental shelf, resulting in a 9C cooling. We use satellite data to assess the frequency, strength and forcing mechanisms of cold events from January 2003
11 through December 2011.

- In this study we investigate in detail the variance of the Agulhas Current velocity field from the [ACT](http://act.rsmas.miami.edu) array, especially focussing on what is happening during meanders, the so-called Natal Pulses. For this we lay out the details of a method of analysis of rotary variance, dubbed Rotary EOF (REOF). We also combined in-situ data from the ACT array with altimetry data to research the origins, and fate, of meanders.

- Ekman’s theory of the wind-driven ocean surface boundary layer assumes a constant eddy viscosity and predicts that the current rotates with depth at the same rate as it decays in amplitude. This study presents a method for estimating ageostrophic currents from shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler data in Drake Passage and finds that observations are consistent with Ekman’s theory.

- This study investigates the coherence between ocean bottom pressure signals at the Rapid Climate Change programme (RAPID) West Atlantic Variability Experiment (WAVE) array on the western North Atlantic continental slope, including the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Line W. We find several types of coherent signals: barotropic kelvin-like waves that propagates at speeds in excess of \\( 128\, m s^{-1} \\), and pressure-difference signals propagating at about \\( 1\, m s^{-1} \\), roughly consistent iwth coastally-trapped waves. These last signals are expected to be associated with depth-dependent basinwide meridional transport variations or an overturning circulation.
