**Shane Elipot, "Methods of Data Analysis in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences".**

This is a series of five lectures I gave during my visit in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Cape Town in summer 2017. Many thanks to Dr. Juliet Hermes from SAEON for making this visit possible and Prof. Isabelle Ansorge for hosting me.

Lecture 1: "Essential Statistics" [{Live Presentation}](lecture1/index.html) or [{download}](lecture1.pdf).

Lecture 2: "Covariance and correlation" [{Live Presentation}](lecture2/index.html) or [{download}](lecture2.pdf).

Lecture 3: "Regression analysis & model fitting" [{Live Presentation}](lecture3/index.html) or [{download}](lecture3.pdf).

Lecture 4: "Time Series Analyses" [{Live Presentation}](lecture4/index.html) or [{download}](lecture4.pdf).

Lecture 5: "Eigen Methods" [{Live Presentation}](lecture5/index.html) or [{download}](lecture5.pdf).

These lectures were followed by practical sessions using the Matlab software. The scripts used for these sessions are available at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5UwZFhQ8OhvWXFSY19YcGZMZEU?resourcekey=0-XN72IcDq6aY0V3CHQ2GdzA&usp=sharing).
