The lecture on time series analyses I gave in Tromso in November 2016 is available [here](tromso/index.html). Note that this presentation calls external libraries from MathJax that may not work under macOS Safari. It should work with Chrome or Firefox if you allow "unsafe" scripts to run. You can also download it as a html file + libraries zip archive [here](tromso.zip), which should work fine offline and in macOS Safari.
