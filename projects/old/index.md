## The Agulhas System Climate Array (ASCA)

![Alt text](/images/algoa.jpg)

I am a co-PI of the Agulhas System Climate Array (ASCA) project, led by Prof Lisa Beal and funded by the U.S.A. National Science Foundation (NSF) for its US component. More broadly, [ASCA](http://asca.dirisa.org) is an international research project with partners from South Africa, the USA, and the Netherlands, with funding support from the South African Departments of Science and Technology (DST) and Environmental Affairs (DEA), the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). It is designed to provide long term observations of Agulhas Current volume, heat and salt transport and its variability from mesoscale (eddies), through seasonal to interannual timescales. This is achieved by means of two shelf and seven full-depth tall moorings, interspersed with five Current- and Pressure-recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES), measuring pressure, current velocities, temperatures and salinities. The ASCA shelf and tall moorings  extend 200 km offshore along the descending TOPEX/Jason satellite ground track \#96, through the core of the Agulhas Current, with CPIES measurements extending the array to 300 km offshore. The project has generated the following publications:

- This paper studies the atmosphere-driven interannual variability of the Agulhas jet transport based on the altimeter proxy derived in [Beal and Elipot (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19853). We find that 29% of the interannual variance of the Agulhas Current transport can be linearly related to six modes of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric variability, including ENSO and a SAM-related mode. The Agulhas transport proxy time series can be downloaded via the [ACT website](http://http://act.rsmas.miami.edu) [here](http://http://act.rsmas.miami.edu/media/publications/).

## Global Observational Constraints on Oceanic Response to Wind Forcing

![Alt text](/images/drifter.jpg "Deploying a drifter in the Agulhas Current. Photo Credit: Kayleen McMonigal")

I lead this NSF-funded collaborative research project with [Dr. J.M. Lilly](www.jmlilly.net) now at Planetary Science Institute and [Dr. R. Harcourt](http://www.apl.washington.edu/people/profile.php?last=Harcourt&first=Ramsey) from the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington. The goal of this project is to better understand the dynamics of the ocean surface boundary layer through the first global study of the wind stress to ocean current *transfer function*. This is to be accomplished by analyzing in detail the response to wind forcing in the global array of surface drifters, which sample the ocean currents in the vicinity of their 15 m drogue depth. The global analysis is to be informed and tested by (i) a prototype study from the SPURS region, near a well-instrumented air-sea flux mooring, and (ii) analysis of synthetic data generated with a recently improved turbulence closure model that explicitly includes Langmuir turbulence. The hypotheses that wind, wave, and stratification state substantially modify near-surface mixing will be tested by examining dependencies of the transfer function on various environmental parameters, such as Langmuir number. Observed patterns will then be interpreted and scrutinized by deriving new theoretical approximations to the expected transfer functions characterizing different mixing processes. This project is officially closed but its related science questions are still very much an area of research for me. This project as generated two publications so far:

* Jonathan M. Lilly and **Elipot, S.** (2021), *A Unifying Perspective on Transfer Function Solutions to the Unsteady Ekman Problem*, [Fluids](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/fluids), 6(2), 85, [dpoi:10.3390/fluids6020085](https://doi.org/10.3390/fluids6020085)

This paper is a revisit of some theoretical aspects of my PhD work, expanding and unifying previous studies including some of the material presented in [Elipot and Gille (2009a)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-5-115-2009).

## An new global hourly surface drifter dataset

![Alt text](/images/globalrotaryspectra123.pdf "Figure 17 of Elipot et al. (2016)")

I have produced with colleagues at [AOML](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov) a new global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution. This dataset is freely available through the [Global Drifter Program Data Assembly Center](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/hourly_data.php) hosted at NOAA/AOML in Miami, FL. The dataset is described in Elipot S., R. Lumpkin, R. C. Perez, J. M. Lilly, J. J. Early and A. M. Sykulski (2016), A global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution, [doi:10.1002/2016JC011716](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC011716). The dataset is regularly updated as new drifter data become available and improvements in the methodology are being made. This project was partly supported by [The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS)](http://http://cimas.rsmas.miami.edu).

### The Agulhas Current Time-Series Experiment (ACT)

The [ACT](http://act.rsmas.miami.edu) project was a series of three expeditions to South Africa led by [Prof. Lisa Beal](https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/people/faculty-index/?p=lisa-beal). I joined the project after the field work, and focused on the analyses of the moored observation data generated by the project. I have contributed so far to three publications:

* Leber, G. M., L. M. Beal and **S. Elipot** (2016), *Classification of Upwelling Events inshore of the Agulhas Current at 34ÂºS*, in revision for J. Phys. Oceanogr., Sept. 2016

### Monitoring and studying the lower limb of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation from in-situ data

I worked at the [UK National Oceanography Centre](http://www.nerc.ac.uk) in Liverpool, UK, on mooring observations at several latitudes of the return and deep flow of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The general topic of my research was to understand the variability of the MOC on intra-annual to inter annual time scales. The name of this program funded by the UK [NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk) is RAPID WAVE from the Rapid Climate Change programme. I have contributed to four peer-reviewed publications for this project:

* **Elipot, S.** et al. (2016), *Observed basin-scale response of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to wind stress forcing*, submitted to J. Clim., Sept. 2016

### What is the polarization of ocean currents?

This question was the central theme of my postdoctoral research project which was first funded by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [National Research Council of the US National Academies](http://www.nationalacademies.org/nasem/). I conducted this research at [AOML](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov) under the advising of [Dr. Rick Lumpkin](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/people/lumpkin/index.php). The second year of this project was funded by the [Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies](http://cimas.rsmas.miami.edu) of the  [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu), Miami, Florida, USA.  This project led to three publications:

* **Elipot, S.** and R. Lumpkin (2008), *Spectral description of oceanic near-surface variability*, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L05606, [doi:10.1029/2007GL032589](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032874).

### The Southern Ocean response to wind forcing

This general theme was the underlying motivation of the PhD project at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](http://www.sio.ucsd.edu) at the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu). I was advised by [Prof. Sarah Gille](http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/). This project led to two peer-reviewed publications in addition to my PhD thesis:

* **Elipot, S.** and S. T. Gille (2009), *Estimates of wind energy input to the Ekman layer in the Southern Ocean from surface drifter data*, J. Geophys. Res., 114, C06003, [doi:10.1029/2008JC-005170](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JC005170).
