# Current Projects

## The Agulhas System Climate Array (ASCA)


I am a co-PI on the Agulhas System Climate Array (ASCA), a project led by Prof Lisa Beal and funded by the US National Science Foundation for its US component. [ASCA](http://asca.dirisa.org) is an international oceanographic project with partners from South Africa, the US, and the Netherlands, and funding support from the South African Departments of Science and Technology (DST) and Environmental Affairs (DEA), the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). It is designed to provide long term observations of Agulhas Current volume, heat and salt transport and its variability from mesoscale (eddies), through seasonal to interannual timescales. This will be achieved by means of two shelf and seven full-depth tall moorings, interspersed with five Current- and Pressure-recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES), measuring pressure, current velocities, temperatures and salinities. The ASCA shelf and tall moorings will extend 200 km offshore along the decending TOPEX/Jason satellite ground track # 96, through the core of the Agulhas Current, with CPIES measurements extending the array to 300 km offshore.

## Global Observational Constraints on Oceanic Response to Wind Forcing


I am leading this NSF-funded collaborative research project with Dr. J.M. Lilly from Northwest Research Associates and Dr. R. Harcourt from APL/University of Washington. The goal of this project is to better understand the dynamics of the ocean surface boundary layer through the first global study of the wind/current transfer function. This is to be accomplished by analyzing in detail the response to wind forcing in the global array of surface drifters, which sample the ocean currents in the vicinity of their 15 m drogue depth. The global analysis is to be informed and tested by (i) a prototype study from the SPURS region, near a well-instrumented air-sea flux mooring, and (ii) analysis of synthetic data generated with a recently improved turbulence closure model that explicitly includes Langmuir turbulence. The hypotheses that wind, wave, and stratification state substantially modify near-surface mixing will be tested by examining dependencies of the transfer function on various environmental parameters, such as Langmuir number. Observed patterns will then be interpreted and scrutinized by deriving new theoretical approximations to the expected transfer functions characterizing different mixing processes.

## An new global hourly surface drifter dataset


I have produced with my colleagues a new global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution. This dataset is freely available through the Global Drifter Program Data Assembly Center hosted at NOAA/AOML in Miami, FL. The dataset is described in Elipot S., R. Lumpkin, R. C. Perez, J. M. Lilly, J. J. Early and A. M. Sykulski (2016), A global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution, [doi:10.1002/2016JC011716](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC011716).

## Monitoring and studying the lower limb of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation from in-situ data


I am working with scientists at the UK National Oceanography Centre in Liverpool and Southampton on mooring observations at several latitudes of the return and deep flow of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). What sets its variability and strength on intra-annual to inter annual time scales? The name of this UK program funded by NERC is RAPID WAVE from the Rapid Climate Change programme.
