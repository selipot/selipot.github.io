I am a physical oceanographer in the [Department of Ocean Sciences](http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/research/departments/ocean-sciences/) at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science](http://rsmas.miami.edu) of [the University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu).

I conduct research in atmosphere-ocean interactions, the oceanic surface boundary layer, the dynamics of the meridional overturning circulation, and the Agulhas Current System. I am interested in the nature of oceanic and atmospheric observations, and more generally in time series and covariance analyses of environmental data.
