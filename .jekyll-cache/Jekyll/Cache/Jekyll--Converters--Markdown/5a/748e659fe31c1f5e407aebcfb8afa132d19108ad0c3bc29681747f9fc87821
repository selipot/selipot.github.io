<p>I conduct research in physical oceanography, and specifically in atmosphere-ocean interactions, oceanic surface boundary layer dynamics, meridional overturning circulation dynamics, and Agulhas Current System dynamics. I am interested in the nature of oceanic and atmospheric observations, and more generally in time series and covariance analyses of environmental data.</p>
