I"¥<p>I just spent 3 very intense but delightful weeks in Cape Town, the mother city of South Africa. Aside from attending the <a href="http://www.iapso-iamas-iaga2017.com">IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA 2017 meeting</a> which was a lot of fun, I visited for two weeks the <a href="http://www.sea.uct.ac.za">Department of Oceanography at the University of Cape Town</a> in order to deliver a series of lectures on methods of data analysis in oceanic and atmospheric sciences. I am very grateful to the Head of Department Prof. Isabelle Ansorge and Dr. Juliet Hermes from <a href="http://www.saeon.ac.za">the South African Environmental Observation Network</a> for making my visit possible.</p>
