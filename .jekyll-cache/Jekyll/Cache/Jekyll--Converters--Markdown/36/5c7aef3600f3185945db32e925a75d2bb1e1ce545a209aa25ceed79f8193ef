I"­<p>Scientists in general, and oceanographers in particular, have been used for many years to sharing â€œtheirâ€ data. A few whine about how difficult it is to obtain funding and acquire the data, and as such should keep their exclusivity. They can for a few years, but in the end it is not really their data anyway, since they most likely originate from projects funded by tax payers, through governmental funding agencies.</p>
