<p>I lead this NSF-funded collaborative research project with <a href="www.jmlilly.net">Dr. J.M. Lilly</a> now at Planetary Science Institute and <a href="http://www.apl.washington.edu/people/profile.php?last=Harcourt&amp;first=Ramsey">Dr. R. Harcourt</a> from the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington. The goal of this project is to better understand the dynamics of the ocean surface boundary layer through the first global study of the wind stress to ocean current <em>transfer function</em>. This is to be accomplished by analyzing in detail the response to wind forcing in the global array of surface drifters, which sample the ocean currents in the vicinity of their 15 m drogue depth. The global analysis is to be informed and tested by (i) a prototype study from the SPURS region, near a well-instrumented air-sea flux mooring, and (ii) analysis of synthetic data generated with a recently improved turbulence closure model that explicitly includes Langmuir turbulence. The hypotheses that wind, wave, and stratification state substantially modify near-surface mixing will be tested by examining dependencies of the transfer function on various environmental parameters, such as Langmuir number. Observed patterns will then be interpreted and scrutinized by deriving new theoretical approximations to the expected transfer functions characterizing different mixing processes. This project is officially closed but its related science questions are still very much an area of research for me. This project as generated two publications so far:</p>

<p>I have produced with colleagues at <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov">AOML</a> a new global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution. This dataset is freely available through the <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/hourly_data.php">Global Drifter Program Data Assembly Center</a> hosted at NOAA/AOML in Miami, FL. The dataset is described in Elipot S., R. Lumpkin, R. C. Perez, J. M. Lilly, J. J. Early and A. M. Sykulski (2016), A global surface drifter dataset at hourly resolution, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC011716">doi:10.1002/2016JC011716</a>. The dataset is regularly updated as new drifter data become available and improvements in the methodology are being made.

<p>The <a href="http://act.rsmas.miami.edu">ACT</a> project was a series of three expeditions to South Africa led by <a href="https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/people/faculty-index/?p=lisa-beal">Prof. Lisa Beal</a>. I joined the project after the field work, and focused on the analyses of the moored observation data generated by the project. I have contributed so far to three publications:</p>

<p>I worked at the <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk">UK National Oceanography Centre</a> in Liverpool, UK, on mooring observations at several latitudes of the return and deep flow of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The general topic of my research was to understand the variability of the MOC on intra-annual to inter annual time scales. The name of this program funded by the UK <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk">NERC</a> is RAPID WAVE from the Rapid Climate Change programme. I have contributed to four peer-reviewed publications for this project:</p>
