I"<<p>I found somehow reassuring to read in a <a href="https://eos.org/editors-vox/stuff-my-reviewers-say?utm_source=eos&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=EosBuzz092316">blog post of  EOS</a> that the Editor in Chief of Geophysical Research Letters, no less, recently had a manuscript rejected for publication. He wrote that <em>“this rejection was particularly deflating, both because I had invested two years in the science, and because two of the three reviewers dismissed the very conception of the analysis.”</em> I see this as being told that your paper sucks because your analysis sucks in the first place. <em>Ouch</em>. We’ve all had at least one terrible story about a particular set of reviews. It turns out that last week was <a href="https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com">Peer Review Week</a>! Who knew?</p>
