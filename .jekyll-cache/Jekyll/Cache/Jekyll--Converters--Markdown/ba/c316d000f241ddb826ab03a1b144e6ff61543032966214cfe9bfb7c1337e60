I"<p>I have been surprised by the continuing use of <em>variance-preserving spectra</em> in the oceanographic literature as a tool to diagnose periodicities in time series (this does not seem to happen in the purely climate literature … we, oceanographers, are often a bit behind). Since I don’t think I know much, I often seek out the help of a couple of statistician friends that deal with time series (like all the time). I have casually asked them: “Why do you think people use variance-preserving spectra?”. Their answer was revealing: they did not even know what a variance-preserving spectrum was! Once I explained to them (see below), they were even more confused. They also wondered what was wrong with us (oceanographers). On a more serious note, what concerns me is that we collectively spend millions of tax-payer dollars to obtain amazing time series of oceanographic variables (such as oceanic volume transport), and sometimes analyze them with the wrong tools, unfortunately. We need to collectively do better.</p>
