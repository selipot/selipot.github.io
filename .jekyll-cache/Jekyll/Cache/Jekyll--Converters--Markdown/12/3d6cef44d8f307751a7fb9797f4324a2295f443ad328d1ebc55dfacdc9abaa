I"‰<p>I finally got around to put my new professional website together! It is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and currently hosted, for free, on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I browsed many resources to approximately understand how this works, and learned to use <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> at a basic level with the online tutorial <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">tryGit</a>. I followed the <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">simple tutorial</a> by Jonathan Mcglone, but then opted for the free Jekyll theme <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme">So Simple</a>.  In the process, I downloaded a free text editor called <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> which I find very neat, at least on Mac OS X. You can easily download a package for Atom that will allow you to use Emacs keybindings, which I am used to.</p>
