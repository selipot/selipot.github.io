I"Ê<p>I found somehow reassuring to read in a <a href="https://eos.org/editors-vox/stuff-my-reviewers-say?utm_source=eos&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=EosBuzz092316">blog post of  EOS</a> that the Editor in Chief of Geophysical Research Letters, no less, recently had a manuscript rejected for publication. He wrote that <em>‚Äúthis rejection was particularly deflating, both because I had invested two years in the science, and because two of the three reviewers dismissed the very conception of the analysis.‚Äù</em> I see this as being told that your paper sucks because your analysis sucks in the first place. <em>Ouch</em>. We‚Äôve all had at least one terrible story about a particular set of reviews. It turns out that last week was <a href="https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com">Peer Review Week</a>! Who knew?</p>

<p>What I found funny is that following this rejection one of his students introduced him to <a href="http://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com">‚ÄúShit my reviewers say‚Äù</a>, the excellent tumblr account which is also on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks">@YourPaperSucks</a> and has been a favorite of mine for some time. If you did not know this wonderful resource of procrastination, happy reading!</p>
