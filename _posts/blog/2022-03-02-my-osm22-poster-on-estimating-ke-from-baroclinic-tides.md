I am posting here the poster I am presenting at the AGU OSM 2022 meeting as part of Session PL09
*Tides in the past, present and future*. Originally on March 2, 2022 at 9:00 PM ET.

*Global mapping of kinematics and dynamics of tidal currents with surface drifters* by Shane Elipot, Edward Zaron, Jonathan M. Lilly, and Rick Lumpkin.
