I found somehow reassuring to read in a [blog post of  EOS](https://eos.org/editors-vox/stuff-my-reviewers-say?utm_source=eos&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EosBuzz092316) that the Editor in Chief of Geophysical Research Letters, no less, recently had a manuscript rejected for publication. He wrote that *"this rejection was particularly deflating, both because I had invested two years in the science, and because two of the three reviewers dismissed the very conception of the analysis."* I see this as being told that your paper sucks because your analysis sucks in the first place. *Ouch*. We've all had at least one terrible story about a particular set of reviews. It turns out that last week was [Peer Review Week](https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com)! Who knew?

What I found funny is that following this rejection one of his students introduced him to ["Shit my reviewers say"](http://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com), the excellent tumblr account which is also on twitter as [@YourPaperSucks](https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks) and has been a favorite of mine for some time. If you did not know this wonderful resource of procrastination, happy reading!
