I finally got around to put my new professional website together! It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and currently hosted, for free, on [GitHub](https://github.com). I browsed many resources to approximately understand how this works, and learned to use [git](https://git-scm.com) at a basic level with the online tutorial [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). I followed the [simple tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan Mcglone, but then opted for the free Jekyll theme [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme).  In the process, I downloaded a free text editor called [Atom](https://atom.io) which I find very neat, at least on Mac OS X. You can easily download a package for Atom that will allow you to use Emacs keybindings, which I am used to.
