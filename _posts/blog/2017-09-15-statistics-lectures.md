I just spent 3 very intense but delightful weeks in Cape Town, the mother city of South Africa. Aside from attending the [IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA 2017 meeting](http://www.iapso-iamas-iaga2017.com) which was a lot of fun, I visited for two weeks the [Department of Oceanography at the University of Cape Town](http://www.sea.uct.ac.za) in order to deliver a series of lectures on methods of data analysis in oceanic and atmospheric sciences. I am very grateful to the Head of Department Prof. Isabelle Ansorge and Dr. Juliet Hermes from [the South African Environmental Observation Network](http://www.saeon.ac.za) for making my visit possible.

My audience was broad and diverse (more than 30 students!), from Masters level to postdoctoral researchers. I am pleased to make now available openly on my website the [slides of these five lectures](/talks/), as well as the Matlab scripts that the students worked with during afternoon practical sessions. I was ambivalent about making the students use a commercial software, as opposed to an open source software like Python. However, In the interest of time and exactness, I had to stick to what I knew. In addition, most of these Matlab scripts are compatible with the Matlab-like free software [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

By the way, I am always grateful to [Jonathan Lilly](http://www.jmlilly.net) who made me embark on this journey of lecturing on stats! And please check out the latest version of his course on time series analysis [here](http://www.jmlilly.net/talks/oslo/v2/index.html).
