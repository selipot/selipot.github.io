      "excerpt"		: "Again and again I am dismayed by the habit of using variance-preserving spectra to diagnose periodicities in time series. This habit is crawling steadily in the observational oceanographic literature (not so much in climate science, they know better). The reasons I can see for this serious problem are twofold: 1) the repeat of analyses from published papers which unfortunately passed the review process, and 2) the lack of statistical training of physical oceanographers. This last reason is unfortunate and should be corrected. Statistics is the science of collecting and analyzing numerical data so we should get on board.  Now, I am not claiming to be a statistician, but I humbly think that I spend more time than others thinking about statistics."

Aside from attending the IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA 2017 meeting which was a lot of fun, I visited for two weeks the Department of Oceanography at the University of Cape Town in order to deliver a series of lectures on methods of data analysis in oceanic and atmospheric sciences. I am very grateful to the Head of Department Prof. Isabelle Ansorge and Dr. Juliet Hermes from the South African Environmental Observation Network for making my visit possible."

The methods of interpolation implemented to generate this product are the same as for version 1.00 of the dataset released in mid-2016, see Elipot et al. 2016, doi:10.1002/2016JC011716.

He wrote that “this rejection was particularly deflating, both because I had invested two years in the science, and because two of the three reviewers dismissed the very conception of the analysis.” I see this as being told that your paper sucks because your analysis sucks in the first place. Ouch. We’ve all had at least one terrible story about a particular set of reviews. It turns out that last week was Peer Review Week! Who knew?"

      "excerpt"		: "Scientists in general, and oceanographers in particular, have been used for many years to sharing “their” data. A few whine about how difficult it is to obtain funding and acquire the data, and as such should keep their exclusivity. They can for a few years, but in the end it is not really their data anyway, since they most likely originate from projects funded by tax payers, through governmental funding agencies."

I browsed many resources to approximately understand how this works, and learned to use git at a basic level with the online tutorial tryGit. I followed the simple tutorial by Jonathan Mcglone, but then opted for the free Jekyll theme So Simple.  In the process, I downloaded a free text editor called Atom which I find very neat, at least on Mac OS X. You can easily download a package for Atom that will allow you to use Emacs keybindings, which I am used to."
