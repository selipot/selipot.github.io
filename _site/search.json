      "excerpt"		: "Scientists in general, and oceanographers in particular, have been used for many years to sharing “their” data. A few whine about how difficult it is to obtain funding and acquire the data, and as such should keep their exclusivity. They can for a few years, but in the end it is not really their data anyway, since they most likely originate from projects funded by tax payers, through governmental funding agencies."

      "excerpt"		: "I finally got around to put my new professional website together! It is powered by Jekyll and currently hosted, for free, on GitHub. I browsed many resources to approximately understand how this works, and learned to use git at a basic level with the online tutorial tryGit. I followed the simple tutorial by Jonathan Mcglone, but then opted for the free Jekyll theme So Simple.  In the process, I downloaded a free text editor called Atom which I find very neat, at least on Mac OS X. You can easily download a package for Atom that will allow you to use Emacs keybindings, which I am used to."
